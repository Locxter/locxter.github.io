                My name is Luca Schultz and I am the person behind the pseudonym locxter. As a technology enthusiast
                from Nothern Germany I love to tinker and find new ways of doing stuff. In my 8 years of programming and
                doing electronics projects I have slowly found love for writing simple and clean yet effective code,
                doing every part of a project I reasonably can on my own and using privacy respecting as well as
                <strong>FOSS</strong>
                software.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently in the progress of switching to
                <strong>Kotlin</strong>
                as my primary programming language, but have extensively worked with
                <strong>C++</strong>
                in the past and also write some Java, Rust as well as JavaScript/TypeScript code from time to time.
                Other than that I prefer to use FreeCAD for designing parts, Inkscape for creating vector graphics,
                VSCodium as my text editor as well as C++/Rust/JavaScript/TypeScript IDE and IntelliJ IDEA as my
                Kotlin/Java IDE. My desktop operating system is heavily customized Linux Mint while I run CalyxOS on my
                phone.
