                My name is Luca Schultz and I am the person behind the pseudonym locxter. As a technology enthusiast from Nothern Germany I love to tinker and find new ways of doing stuff. In my 8 years of programming and doing electronics projects I have slowly found love for writing simple and clean yet effective code, doing every part of a project I reasonably can on my own and using privacy respecting as well as
                <strong>FOSS</strong>
                software.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently working with
                <strong>C++</strong>
                as my primary programming language, but also write some Java as well as JavaScript code from time to time. Other than that I prefer to use FreeCAD for designing parts, Inkscape for creating vector graphics and VSCodium as my text editor as well as IDE. My desktop operating system is Linux Mint while I run CalyxOS on my phone.
