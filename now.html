            <h3>Priorities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Getting started in my dual study program at a big German automotive company:</strong>
                    Right now I'm in the very intersting, but also quite challenging situation of having just moved to
                    Stuttgart and starting to work at a big German automotive company as a part of my dual study
                    program. Besides the work itself and preparing for university, this requires me explore a new
                    surrounding, meet foreign people everywhere and build a new network - all of which I really enjoy
                    until now.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Experimenting with producing YouTube videos:</strong>
                    After finishing a first working version of my project BotvacCenter, I produced a quite long
                    explainer video for YouTube, which suprisingly got over 1.500 views so far. With this success, I
                    decided to experiment with producing YouTube videos for a few months and see where this leads me.
                    Even if it totally fails, I'm sure that it will offer some valuable insights to me and extent my
                    skill set. Feel free to

                    <strong>Exercising in the gym and becoming fitter:</strong>
                    I'm already actively biking and running, but now also want to train in a more balanced way and build
                    some strength. Not always easy, but I have a training schedule and am working on it.

            <h3>Values</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Life is too short to do things you hate.</strong></li>
                <li>The goal is not to become better than others, but better than yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>An idiot admires complexity - a genius admires simplicity.</strong></li>
                <li>Perfection is gained through mediocrity with persistence.</li>
                <li><strong>Seek discomfort.</strong></li>
            </ul>
