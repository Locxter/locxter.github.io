            <p>
                This is my "Now" page where I share what I'm currently doing, inspired by
                <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a>
                .

            <h3>Priorities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Leveling-up my productivity game:</strong>
                    I have always been rather structured, but lately I really want to make the most of my time and not
                    waste it on things that I don't care about or that don't move the needle. Therefore, I'm currently
                    precisely planning my weeks, reading some productivity books and working my way through the
                    <a href="https://fokus.so">Fokus Framework</a>
                    as well as Getting Things Done methodology.

                <li>
                    <strong>Getting through the last few months of school and preparing for my Abitur:</strong>
                    Here in Germany, we have to go through 13 years of school and I'm finally on homestretch of mine. So
                    as not to be lazy and regret my final grade, I'm really trying to do my best in school and will
                    start preparing for the final Abitur exams early with flashcards and so on.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Organizing my years' graduation newspaper, funding and prom:</strong>
                    Alongside the school graduation itself, my year has to write a graduation newspaper, find a way to
                    fund everything we do and organize a prom, all of which I'm heavily invested in. This takes up a lot
                    of time, but is also very rewarding.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Exercising in the gym and becoming fitter:</strong>
                    I'm already actively biking and running, but now also want to train in a more balanced way and build
                    some strength. Not always easy, but I have a training schedule and am working on it.

            <h3>Values</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Life is too short to do things you hate.</strong></li>
                <li>We don't have too little time in our lifes, but just don't use enough of it.</li>
                <li>The goal is not to become better than others, but better than yourself.</li>
                <li>An idiot admires complexity - a genius admires simplicity.</li>
                <li>Skipping a habit once is human, but never skip it twice!</li>
            </ul>
