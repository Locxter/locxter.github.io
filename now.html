            <h2>What I'm doing now</h2>
            <p>
                This is my "Now" page where I share what I'm currently doing, inspired by
                <a href="https://sive.rs/now">Derek Sivers</a>
                .
            </p>

            <h3>Priorities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>
                        Enjoying the time between finishing school and beginning a dual study program at a big German
                        automative company:
                    </strong>
                    Unlike many others, I'm not taking a gap year after school and will start straight into studying
                    later this year, which creates the need to fully enjoy my free time in between. Besides some
                    necessary university preparation, there are quite a few awesome trips and events planned - just to
                    make sure that it doesn't get boring ;)
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Developing a new software project that challenges my skills and expands my horizon:</strong>
                    It's a shame to admit, but in the last year or so I really haven't started a new exciting software
                    project with major challenges to overcome. Sure, there we some projects in the meantime, but their
                    challenges mostly lay in the electronics department. That's why I will start a new software one in
                    the near future and want to expand my horizon with it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Exercising in the gym and becoming fitter:</strong>
                    I'm already actively biking and running, but now also want to train in a more balanced way and build
                    some strength. Not always easy, but I have a training schedule and am working on it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Values</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Life is too short to do things you hate.</strong></li>
                <li>The goal is not to become better than others, but better than yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>An idiot admires complexity - a genius admires simplicity.</strong></li>
                <li>Perfection is gained through mediocrity with persistence.</li>
                <li><strong>Prioritize health and reduce friction.</strong></li>
            </ul>
