                This is my "Now" page where I share what I'm currently doing, inspired by

            <h3>Priorities</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong> Preparing for my dual study program at a big German automotive company: </strong>
                    Before starting my dual study program and moving to another city across most of Germany, I want to
                    get into the best shape possible in terms of math skills and some other preparable aspects. This
                    requires quite a lot time right now, but will surely turn out to be one of the best investments
                    possible further down the line.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Developing a new software project that challenges my skills and expands my horizon:</strong>
                    It's a shame to admit, but in the last year or so I really haven't started a new exciting software
                    project with major challenges to overcome. Sure, there were some projects in the meantime, but their
                    challenges mostly lay in the electronics department. That's why I have started a new software one
                    called
                    <a href="https://github.com/locxter/BotvacCenter">BotvacCenter</a>
                    and want to expand my horizon with it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Exercising in the gym and becoming fitter:</strong>
                    I'm already actively biking and running, but now also want to train in a more balanced way and build
                    some strength. Not always easy, but I have a training schedule and am working on it.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Values</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Life is too short to do things you hate.</strong></li>
                <li>The goal is not to become better than others, but better than yourself.</li>
                <li><strong>An idiot admires complexity - a genius admires simplicity.</strong></li>
                <li>Perfection is gained through mediocrity with persistence.</li>
                <li><strong>Seek discomfort.</strong></li>
            </ul>
